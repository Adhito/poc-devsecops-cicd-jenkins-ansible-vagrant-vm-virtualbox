## Install WSL For Windows 11 / Windows 10 Users

You can install WSL from the command line. Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator (we recommend using [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-running-windows-terminal)) and run:

```{code-block} text
> wsl --install
```

This command will enable the features necessary to run WSL and also install the default Ubuntu distribution of Linux available in the Microsoft Store. It is recommended to reboot your machine after this initial installation to complete the setup. You can also install WSL from the Microsoft Store.
